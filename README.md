# Smart Watering System

This project simulates a **Smart Watering System** using an ESP32 microcontroller. It monitors soil moisture, controls a water pump (LED), and logs data to a ThingSpeak IoT dashboard.

## Features
- Reads soil moisture sensor values.
- Controls a water pump (simulated with an LED).
- Sends data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for real-time monitoring.

## Components
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Potentiometer (Simulates Soil Moisture Sensor)
- LED (Simulates Water Pump)
- ThingSpeak IoT Dashboard

## Circuit Diagram
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Connected to GPIO 34.
- **Water Pump (LED)**: Connected to GPIO 2.
